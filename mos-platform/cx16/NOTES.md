# Commander X16 llvm-mos-sdk notes

llvm-mos-sdk CX16 kernel stubs - Xark 2023 - [https://github.com/XarkLabs](https://github.com/XarkLabs)

TODO: Find way to have a cx16 specific assembly inc file (vs commodore-asminc) vs re-define (e.g.) cx16 virtual regs inline.
TODO: Do fb_* function wrappers make sense?  Should these be calling via RAM vectors (or additional ifb_* versions)?
