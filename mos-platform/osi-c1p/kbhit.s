; The method to detect a pressed key is based on the documentation in
; "Section 3 Programmed Key Functions" in "The Challenger Character Graphics
; Reference Manual"
; We only want to return true for characters that can be returned by getchar(),
; but not for keys like <Shift> or <Ctrl>. Therefore a special handling is
; needed for the first row. This is implemented by a bit mask that is stored
; in KBDTMP and that is set to zero after the first round.

; Put keyboard state into dedicated zero-page storage.
;
; "za" attribute means:
;       "z": allocate in page zero
;       "a": section is "allocatable", must be allocated a runtime address
.section .zp.bss.kbd,"za",@nobits

; Internal state that needs to be preserved across calls.
; The getchar() function uses __CHARBUF to retrieve
; the return value.
